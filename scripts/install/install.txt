Instructions to install all jelix sites
=======================================

- copy the scripts/scripts.config.sh.dist to scripts/scripts.config.sh
- edit the file scripts/scripts.config.sh, and set all config parameters

- you can use all scripts/install/apache/*.conf files for your locale apache configuration
  perhaps you will have some propertie to change in it.
  You may add some variables in the envvars apache conf file.

- retrieve backup files (ask to the project leader). Then launch the restore_backup by indicating
  the path of the directory where backup files are stored:
  
  scripts/restore_backup.sh path/to/backup/dir

- You should then put rights for the apache user on some directories. Run this script:
  
  sudo scripts/change_rights.sh www-data
  
  where www-data is the apache user. Indicate an other name if needed.

- setup mailer configuration in:

  portal/var/config/defaultconfig.ini.php

- install cron scripts stored in scripts/cronscript

- restart apache
